### Secure Biometric Fingerprint Authentication using ML


This project aims to develop a secure fingerprint authentication system utilizing machine learning (ML) to enhance recognition accuracy
and improve security measures to protect fingerprint data. By improving fingerprint recognition accuracy and protecting data, we aim to address
key security challenges. We will use publicly available fingerprint datasets, preprocess the data, and develop machine learning models for
accurate recognition. To ensure security, we will encrypt the fingerprint data and use secure communication protocols. We will also implement
measures to prevent spoofing attacks. The goal is to build a reliable and secure fingerprint authentication system that enhances both accuracy and data protection.
